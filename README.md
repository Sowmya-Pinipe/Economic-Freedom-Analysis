## 📌 Introduction

Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control their own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please. Governments allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely and refrain from coercion or constraint beyond what is necessary to maintain liberty itself.

This project is based on the **2022 Index of Economic Freedom**, an annual guide published by **The Heritage Foundation**. The dataset includes 12 factors grouped into four broad categories:

### Pillars of Economic Freedom:
1. **Rule of Law** – Property rights, Government integrity, Judicial effectiveness  
2. **Government Size** – Government spending, Tax burden, Fiscal health  
3. **Regulatory Efficiency** – Business freedom, Labor freedom, Monetary freedom  
4. **Open Markets** – Trade freedom, Investment freedom, Financial freedom

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize the economic freedom indicators across different countries.
- Explore relationships between:
  - GDP (PPP)
  - Inflation
  - Unemployment
  - Monetary Freedom
- Identify patterns among high vs low freedom economies.
- Create an interactive and narrative-based Tableau Story to summarize insights.
