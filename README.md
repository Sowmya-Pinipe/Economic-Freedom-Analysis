## 🌐 Project Overview

Economic freedom reflects how easily people can work, produce, trade, and invest without excessive government interference. Countries with high economic freedom tend to experience greater prosperity, higher GDP growth, and better social outcomes.

This project analyzes the **Index of Economic Freedom (2022)** published by The Heritage Foundation. It explores how economic freedom relates to GDP, inflation, monetary freedom, and other economic indicators.
